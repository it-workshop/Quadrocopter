This repository contains the code for the DIY Quadcopter project by Technoworks team (2012 -- 2015)

There exist [http://web.archive.org/web/20141016114551/http://habrahabr.ru/company/technoworks/blog/216437/ an article] <i>(in Russian)</i> which explains the internals of this repository.

Currently the project uses Arduino Due and sensors InvenSense MPU-6050 (with DMP access) and HMC5883L.

Quadcopter is controlled via a designated RF controller.

[https://github.com/it-workshop/Quadrocopter/tree/master/control/qt The Desktop Qt software] connects to the drone using XBee Pro for obtaining debug information.

'''Essentials:'''

* Software for quadcopter: [http://arduino.cc/ Arduino] (beta-version for Due), [https://github.com/it-workshop/i2cdevlib i2cdevlib], [https://github.com/it-workshop/pwm01.h_by_randomvibe pwm01.h]
* The flight control software: [http://qt-project.org/ Qt 4], [https://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/ qextserialport], Qwt 5
* Additionally, Wine might be required for the [http://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=3352&osvid=57&type=utilities X-CTU] program (for XBee setup).
